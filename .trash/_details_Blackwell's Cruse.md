**Race**: Human (Undead after resurrection)  
**Class**: Former noble, now a **Death Knight**  
**Alignment**: Lawful Evil  
**Status**: Once the head of the Blackwell family, now resurrected as a Death Knight

 ###### **Backstory**:
Lord Hagrave Blackwell was once the patriarch of the influential Blackwell family, a noble house known for its wealth, prestige, and connection to arcane knowledge. However, Hagrave’s thirst for power and immortality led him down a dark path. Obsessed with preserving his family’s legacy and ensuring that his name would never be forgotten, he began to study forbidden magic and necromancy.

Hagrave made a **pact with a malevolent spirit**, promising his soul and that of his family in exchange for immense power. This bargain ultimately led to the family’s downfall. Hagrave’s mind was slowly consumed by the spirit, and during a final ritual to merge with it and achieve eternal life, the ritual backfired. Instead of immortality, the ritual brought ruin to the Blackwell family, resulting in Hagrave’s death and the curse that plagued the mansion. His wife, Lady Blackwell, and other family members also fell victim to the curse, their souls trapped and corrupted.

###### **Personality**:

- **Prideful**: Hagrave was an ambitious, proud man who believed he could outwit death and bend the forces of the afterlife to his will. He viewed his family’s legacy as the most important thing, even at the expense of their happiness or safety.
    
- **Manipulative**: He convinced Lady Blackwell to support his dark pursuits, manipulating her loyalty and love to further his agenda. He often lied to his family, assuring them his arcane experiments were for the greater good.
    
- **Tortured**: After his death, Hagrave’s soul became bound to the mansion as a vengeful spirit, tormented by his failure to control the dark forces. His pride, however, kept him from accepting defeat. When resurrected as a Death Knight, his mind was twisted, but his desire for power and control remained intact.

- **Vengeance**: He harbors deep resentment toward the world for his failure. Upon his resurrection, Hagrave wants to expand his dark dominion, using the malevolent powers he has gained to terrorize the living and exact vengeance on anyone who stands in his way.

### Key Items
##### **The Obelisk Relic**
The **Obelisk Relic** is the heart of the curse and the source of Hagrave Blackwell's resurrection. Its dark, otherworldly power fuels his return and sustains him during the final battle. Surrounding the obelisk are four **eternal flames**, standing on ancient fire stands, which protect and empower the relic. The players must extinguish these flames before they can destroy the obelisk and stop Hagrave's regeneration.

###### **Appearance**:
	**Obelisk**: 
		The obelisk itself is made of a jet-black, reflective stone that pulses with eerie, malevolent energy. It stands around 10 feet tall, with intricate, glowing runes carved into its surface. These runes are written in an ancient, forbidden language and glow a dim purple or red, representing the dark pact Hagrave made. As the players approach, the obelisk hums with a low, ominous resonance, filling the air with tension.
	**Eternal Flames**:  
		Surrounding the obelisk are four tall, gothic **fire stands**. Each stand is forged from black iron, adorned with twisted, demonic faces and symbols. At the top of each stand burns an **eternal flame**, which crackles with an unnatural, purple-black fire. These flames protect the obelisk, feeding its dark power. The flames are tethered to the obelisk, and as long as they burn, the obelisk cannot be destroyed.
###### **Function**:
The **eternal flames** not only protect the obelisk but also act as conduits for its power, constantly regenerating Hagrave's life force. If the players don't extinguish the flames, Hagrave will continue to regenerate, making him nearly impossible to defeat.

---

###### **How to Extinguish the Eternal Flames**:

The eternal flames cannot be put out by mundane means. Each flame is tied to the dark magic that sustains Hagrave and his curse, requiring specific actions or items to extinguish.

1. **Arcane Runic Glyphs**: Around the base of each fire stand, glowing **arcane glyphs** are carved into the stone floor. These glyphs are magical locks, binding the eternal flames to the obelisk. The players will need to perform a ritual or destroy the glyphs to sever the connection. Destroying or disabling the glyphs requires a **successful Arcana check** or the use of dispelling magic.
    
2. **Holy Water or Radiant Damage**: The eternal flames are tied to necromantic energy, meaning that **holy water** or **radiant damage** can disrupt their magic. If the players apply holy water to the flames or use radiant-based spells (such as _Light_ or _Sacred Flame_), the flames will flicker and eventually be extinguished. A total of three successful applications of holy water or radiant damage should suffice to put out one flame.
    
3. **Disabling the Fire Stands**: The fire stands themselves are enchanted, and the players could attempt to physically disable or destroy them. This would require brute force, such as smashing them with a weapon, which could be done after making **successful Strength checks**. Once a fire stand is broken, its flame is extinguished, weakening the obelisk's protective power.
    

---

###### **Final Stage – Destroying the Obelisk**:

Once all four flames are extinguished, the **glowing runes** on the obelisk begin to dim. The obelisk becomes vulnerable to attack, and players can focus on destroying it. However, it is resistant to conventional attacks and requires **magical damage** to break its structure completely.

- The players may need to make **targeted attacks** using spells or magical weapons to crack the obelisk. The moment it is destroyed, the obelisk's connection to Hagrave breaks, leaving him vulnerable.

---

###### **Visual Impact During the Battle**:

- As each eternal flame is extinguished, the **runic energy** from the obelisk fades slightly, and Hagrave’s regeneration weakens. The room's atmosphere shifts, the shadows grow less intense, and the obelisk’s hum quiets.
- When the obelisk is finally destroyed, there’s a bright flash of energy, and the relic shatters into fragments, releasing the souls it has trapped, including Lady Blackwell’s. The room's oppressive air lightens, and Hagrave’s connection to his unholy power is severed.

This setup adds a dynamic layer to the final battle, as the players need to balance fighting Hagrave while disabling the obelisk’s defenses, making it a tense and strategic encounter.
