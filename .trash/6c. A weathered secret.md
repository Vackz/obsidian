Ah, I see! Let’s revise the monologue with Lady Blackwell remaining visible in the mirror.

---

### English
	
	As you rummage through the room, you discover a small, weathered box tucked away in the corner, half-concealed beneath the bed. Its once-polished surface has dulled with age, a thin layer of dust covering it. With care, you open the box. Inside, a worn leather-bound journal rests atop a few coins and personal trinkets that likely belonged to the butler.
	
	The journal’s pages are yellowed, the ink faded but legible. As you reach for it, the room grows still, a chill filling the air. From the corner of your eye, you catch a shift in the mirror. Lady Blackwell’s sorrowful figure remains, her eyes now fixed on the box you hold. She doesn’t vanish. Her expression, weighed down by grief, seems to pierce through the glass as she stares at the journal, locked in a moment of remembrance.
	
	No matter where you stand, she remains in the reflection—her face ever turned towards both mirrors, impossibly facing you from both angles. Her presence lingers, her gaze following the box. If you turn away from the mirror, her figure does not disappear. She watches, silently mourning, but never turning her back.

### Chinese Monologue (中文独白):

_“当你四处搜寻时，你发现一个小巧的旧盒子藏在角落里，半埋在床底下。它曾经光亮的表面如今已然失去光泽，盖着一层薄薄的灰尘。你小心翼翼地打开盒子，里面是一把旧皮革日记，一些硬币和几件可能属于管家的个人物品。”_

_“日记的纸张已经泛黄，墨迹虽已褪色但依旧清晰。当你伸手去拿时，房间突然变得死寂，一股寒气弥漫四周。你眼角的余光瞥见镜中有了变化。黑维尔夫人的身影依然伫立，眼神这次却死死地盯着你手中的盒子。她没有消失。她的表情依旧沉浸在悲伤中，双眼仿佛透过镜子凝视着那本日记，似乎陷入了记忆的长河。”_

_“无论你站在哪个位置，她的身影始终在镜中出现——她的面庞不可思议地同时对着两面镜子，似乎总在注视着你。她的存在感在房间中弥漫，她的目光始终追随着盒子。如果你移开目光，她的形象并不会消失。她静静地看着，充满哀伤，却从未转身。”_

In this version, Lady Blackwell remains in the mirrors, her presence constantly felt. She gazes mournfully at the butler’s belongings but does not disappear. Instead, she watches the players, a reminder of the sorrow and tragedy bound to the house.
