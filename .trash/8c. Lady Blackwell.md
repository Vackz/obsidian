### English

	"You’ve come to lift the curse, haven’t you? Just like the ones before you... but they failed. Only one of them survived—Jonas. I tried to reach him, to guide him... but my presence terrified him, and he fled, leaving this burden behind. I am no monster, though Hargrave has become one. You must succeed where they did not."
	
	(She looks mournfully at the players through the mirror.)
	
	"There is a way. The pendant you seek... it can stop all of this. It’s locked within the mirror, as I am. The pendant holds the key to ending the nightmare that has consumed this house. But be warned, it is not easy to obtain."
	
	(She motions to the mirror, her voice becoming more insistent.)
	
	"You will have to shatter the barrier or perform a ritual to free it, just as you would free me. But once you have it, you can put an end to Hargrave's torment—or so it seems. The truth is more dangerous than you know. The pendant... it doesn’t just end the curse, it will bring Hargrave back, stronger than ever. You must decide—will you use it and risk everything, or find another way?"

	“你们是来解除诅咒的，对吗？就像之前那些人……但他们失败了。只有一个人活了下来——乔纳斯。我试图与他沟通，想引导他……但我的出现吓坏了他，他逃走了，将这个负担留在了这里。我不是怪物，尽管哈格雷夫已经变成了一个怪物。你们必须在他们失败的地方取得成功。”
	
	（她透过镜子忧伤地看着玩家。）

	“有一个办法。你们寻找的吊坠……它可以终结这一切。它被锁在镜子里，正如我一样。吊坠掌握着结束这个噩梦的关键，噩梦吞噬了这座房子。但要警告你，得到它并不容易。”
	
	（她指向镜子，语气变得更加急切。）
	
	“你们必须打破屏障，或者进行仪式来释放它，就像你们会释放我一样。但一旦你们拥有它，就可以终结哈格雷夫的痛苦——至少表面上是这样。真相比你们想象的更危险。吊坠……它不仅仅是结束诅咒的钥匙，它还会让哈格雷夫复活，变得比以前更强大。你们必须决定——是使用它并冒着一切风险，还是找到其他办法？”
