## Session 1
### 1. Intro
	Years ago, the wealthy Blackwell family was the pride of the village. Known for their lavish parties and seemingly endless fortune, their name commanded both respect and envy. However, their fortune came at a dark price. The patriarch, Lord Hargrave Blackwell, made a pact with a malevolent spirit to secure the family’s wealth. In exchange, the Blackwell family’s bloodline was cursed. Strange and tragic deaths plagued the family, and over time, the once-grand mansion fell into disrepair. Now, the villagers whisper that the Blackwell spirits haunt the old mansion, and the curse has started to affect the nearby village as well.
	
	多年前，富有的布莱克威尔家族是村庄的骄傲。他们以奢华的宴会和似乎无尽的财富闻名，布莱克威尔的名字既受到尊敬，也引来嫉妒。然而，他们的财富背后隐藏着一个黑暗的代价。家族的族长哈格雷夫·布莱克威尔勋爵与一个邪恶的灵体达成了协议，以确保家族的财富。作为交换，布莱克威尔家族的血脉被诅咒。诡异而悲惨的死亡接连降临在家族成员身上，曾经辉煌的宅邸逐渐破败。如今，村民们悄悄议论说，布莱克威尔家族的鬼魂依旧徘徊在那座老宅中，而这诅咒也开始影响附近的村庄。
### 2. Quest Details
Meet up with Quest Giver **Mayor Eliza Hargrave** at a local inn in the quite village of **Blackwell Hollow**

- English:

		As you push open the heavy wooden door to the Inn, the soft hum of conversation and the warmth of a crackling fire greets you. The dim light of the early evening filters through the windows, casting long shadows across the room, but your attention is drawn to a figure seated at a corner table.
		
		Eliza, the mayor's aide, waits patiently for you, her auburn hair catching the flicker of the hearthlight as she shuffles through a pile of papers. Her eyes, sharp and calculating, glance up as you approach. She gestures for you to sit without a word, her expression serious, more so than your previous meeting.
		
		“You’re right on time. Please, have a seat. There’s much we need to discuss.”
		
		Her voice, though calm, carries an undercurrent of urgency. She leans forward, folding her hands atop the table.
		
		“I’m sure you’ve heard whispers by now—rumors about the Blackwell Mansion and its curse. Well, I’m here to confirm that those rumors are true.”_\
		
		She pauses for a moment, her eyes flicking toward the entrance, as if waiting for someone. And then, as if on cue, the door creaks open once more. A hunched, weathered figure steps in, his footsteps slow, deliberate. He carries an air of age and wisdom—his clothes old but well-kept, and his silver beard giving him the look of someone who has seen far too many winters.
		
		“Jonas,” Eliza says softly, beckoning him over. _“Come, sit. These are the ones who’ll be handling the Blackwell business.”_
		
		The old man, Jonas, nods in acknowledgment as he hobbles over. His eyes, clouded with years of hardship, gleam with something akin to recognition, as if he’s seen adventurers like you before, many times. He takes a seat beside Eliza, letting out a weary sigh before speaking.**
		
		_“The Blackwell Mansion,”_ he begins, his voice rough like gravel, _“is a place no sane person should ever walk. But I’m afraid the curse will spread if someone doesn’t do somethin’ about it. The spirits... they’ve stirred. Restless, angry. They’ve started comin’ out of the graveyard at night. Soon, it’ll be worse.”_
		
		Jonas leans forward, eyes hardening as he looks at each of you in turn.**
		
		“I know that place well—too well. I can tell you what I know, guide you... but be warned. The curse ain’t just somethin’ that’ll spook ya. It’s got claws. The Blackwells played with powers they shouldn’t have, and now, you’ll have to deal with the consequences.”
		
		Eliza clears her throat, her voice cutting through the tension.
		
		_“Jonas will tell you what he knows about the mansion, but the mayor is counting on you. Find the source of this curse, put an end to it, and free the town from the Blackwells' dark legacy. I’ll provide whatever aid I can, but once you enter that mansion, you’re on your own.”_
		
		The weight of the task before you sinks in as Jonas leans back, nodding solemnly. You realize now that this is more than just a job—it’s a fight against a curse that has loomed over Blackwell Hollow for generations. And now, it falls to you to lift it.
- Chinese:

		当你推开旅店沉重的木门时，轻柔的谈话声和壁炉里劈啪作响的火焰温暖地迎接了你。傍晚昏暗的光线透过窗户洒进来，在房间里投下长长的阴影，但你的注意力被吸引到了角落的一张桌子上。
		
		市长的助手伊丽莎正耐心地等着你，她的红褐色头发在炉火的闪烁中闪耀着光芒，她一边翻阅着一堆文件。她锐利而深思熟虑的目光在你走近时抬了起来。她没有说话，只是用手示意你坐下，她的表情比你们上次见面时更加严肃。
		
		“你来得正是时候。请坐下，我们有很多事情要讨论。”
		
		她的声音虽然平静，但带着一丝紧迫感。她向前倾身，将双手交叉放在桌面上。
		
		“我想你现在已经听到一些传闻了——关于布莱克威尔庄园和它的诅咒。嗯，我在这里就是要证实那些传闻是真的。”
		
		她停顿了一会儿，目光瞥向入口，仿佛在等什么人。就在那时，仿佛是应声而动，门再次发出嘎吱声，一个佝偻的老者慢慢地走了进来，他的脚步缓慢而沉稳。他带着一种岁月赋予的智慧气息——他的衣服虽然陈旧，但整理得当，而他那银白色的胡须让他看起来像是经历了太多寒冬的人。
		
		“乔纳斯，”伊丽莎轻声说道，示意他过来。“坐下吧。这些人将负责处理布莱克威尔的事情。”
	
		老者乔纳斯点头致意，蹒跚着走了过来。他那饱经风霜的眼睛里透着某种熟悉感，仿佛他之前见过许多像你们这样的冒险者。他在伊丽莎旁边坐下，发出一声疲惫的叹息，然后开口说道：
		
		“布莱克威尔庄园，”他开口道，声音像砂砾般粗哑，“是一个没有理智的人永远不该踏足的地方。但我担心，如果没人做点什么，诅咒会蔓延开来。那些灵魂……已经开始躁动，充满了愤怒。他们夜晚开始从墓地里走出来。很快，情况会更糟。”
		
		乔纳斯向前倾身，目光变得更加坚定，逐一看着你们每一个人。
		
		“我对那个地方很熟——太熟了。我可以告诉你们我所知道的一切，指引你们……但请记住，诅咒不仅仅是让你受惊的东西。它有爪牙。布莱克威尔家族玩弄了不该触碰的力量，现在，你们必须面对后果。”
		
		伊丽莎清了清嗓子，声音打破了紧张的气氛。
		
		“乔纳斯会告诉你们他所知道的关于庄园的事，但市长指望你们。找到这诅咒的源头，结束它，解救小镇，摆脱布莱克威尔家族的黑暗遗产。我会尽力提供任何帮助，但一旦你们进入那座庄园，你们只能靠自己了。”
		
		随着乔纳斯向后靠去，庄重地点头，这项任务的重量在你心中愈发沉重。你现在意识到，这不仅仅是一项工作——这是一场与笼罩布莱克威尔村几代人的诅咒的斗争。而现在，解除它的重任落在了你们身上。

### 3. To the Mansion
You follow Jonas's direction and take on the journey to the Blackwell's Mansion.

- English

		The road stretches out before you, winding through the dense trees of Blackwell Hollow, the path barely visible under the fading light of the moon. There is no sound but the crunch of your boots against the dirt and the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. But it isn’t long before you start to hear... other things.
		
		In the distance, a long, low howl cuts through the still night air, making your hair stand on end. It’s followed by another, closer now, and for a moment, you feel the oppressive weight of the dark forest closing in around you. Somewhere unseen, a wolf howls once again, but this time, there’s something off about it—almost... unnatural.
		
		Every few minutes, the wind carries the faintest sound of something else: a groan, like a twisted echo of pain, or perhaps hunger, just out of reach. The deeper into the hollow you go, the more these noises grow—subtle at first, but soon they become louder, more unsettling, as if the shadows themselves are alive with the whispers of the cursed dead.
		
		Yet nothing appears. No eyes in the woods, no claws in the dark—only the constant weight of dread pressing down on you with each step. The road is empty, but it feels like you're being watched, like something waits just beyond your vision.
- Chinese :

		道路在你们面前延伸，蜿蜒穿过布莱克威尔谷地浓密的树木，月光逐渐消退，几乎无法照亮前方的路径。除了靴子踩在泥土上的嘎吱声和偶尔的风吹叶响，四周一片寂静。然而，不久后，你们开始听到……其他声音。
		
		远处，一声低沉悠长的嚎叫划破静谧的夜空，让你们的汗毛竖了起来。接着，又是一声嚎叫，这次更近了。你感受到黑暗森林的压抑，如同向你们缓缓逼近。某处看不见的地方，一只狼再次嚎叫，但这次，有些不对劲——那声音几乎……不自然。
		
		每隔几分钟，风会带来另一种声音：像是扭曲的痛苦回声，或许是饥饿的呻吟，微弱得仿佛来自远处。你们越深入谷地，这些声音就越多——最初隐约可闻，但很快，它们变得越来越响，越来越令人不安，仿佛黑暗中的阴影充满了被诅咒死者的低语。
		
		然而，什么都没有出现。树林中没有眼睛注视你们，黑暗中没有爪子袭来——只有每一步都加重的恐惧感。道路上空无一人，但你们感到被注视着，仿佛某种东西在你们视线之外等待。

### 4. Ghoul infested graveyard (Encounter #1)
English:

	Finally, after what feels like hours, the towering shape of the Blackwell Mansion looms into view, a shadowy silhouette against the moonlit sky. Its ancient walls, overgrown with dead vines, seem to pulse with a malevolent energy, as though the mansion itself is alive and aware of your presence. The moment your feet touch the broken stone path leading through the mansion’s graveyard, you feel it.
	
	A sharp gust of wind sweeps through the trees, and for the briefest moment, the eerie noises from the forest fall silent. The stillness is unnerving, as though the very world is holding its breath. Then, a sudden scraping noise breaks the silence.
	
	From the nearby graves, you hear the unmistakable sound of earth shifting, and then—breaking through the surface—rotting hands claw their way out of the ground. Three ghouls rise from their long-forgotten resting places, their twisted bodies jerking and twitching as if the mansion itself has summoned them to protect its secrets. Their glowing eyes lock onto you, filled with hunger and malice.
	“The dead don’t rest easy here...”
	
	Before you can take another step, the ghouls lurch forward, moving faster than you expected, their claws outstretched, seeking your flesh. The fight has begun.
Chinese:

	终于，经过似乎漫长的行走，布莱克威尔庄园的高大轮廓映入眼帘，它在月光下的天际中，仿佛是一个阴森的黑影。古老的墙壁，被枯死的藤蔓覆盖，仿佛充满了恶意的能量，庄园仿佛是活的，且知晓你们的存在。当你们的脚步踏上通往庄园墓地的破碎石路时，你们感受到了某种不同。
	
	一阵突如其来的强风扫过树林，短暂的瞬间里，森林中那些诡异的声音突然停歇。静谧让人不安，仿佛整个世界都屏住了呼吸。然后，一声突然的刮擦声打破了寂静。
	
	从附近的坟墓中，你们听到泥土移动的声音，随即——从地面破出腐烂的手掌，开始抓挠地面。三个食尸鬼从被遗忘的长眠中升起，它们扭曲的身体不安地抽搐着，仿佛庄园本身唤醒了它们，来守护它的秘密。它们发光的眼睛锁定了你们，充满了饥饿与恶意。
	
	“这里的死者不安宁……”
	
	还没等你们迈出下一步，食尸鬼便猛然向前冲来，比你们预料的速度更快，它们的爪子伸向你们，渴望撕裂你们的血肉。战斗已经开始。

### 5. Enter the Mansion (Encounter #2)
English:

	As you step through the threshold of the Blackwell Mansion, a shiver runs down your spine. The air inside is thick with dust, and the stale scent of decay wraps around you like a shroud. The flickering light from your torches dances across the faded wallpaper, revealing grotesque patterns that seem to twist and writhe in the shadows. The grand foyer is empty, save for the echoes of your footsteps against the cold, wooden floor.
	
	Suddenly, the heavy door behind you swings shut with a loud thud, reverberating through the hall. You turn to see the door latch itself, as if it has a will of its own, locking you inside. A feeling of unease washes over you, and just as you prepare to voice your concern, you notice movement in the dim light.
	
	From the corners of the room, two large, crawling hands emerge from the shadows—dark, bony, and twisted, like the remnants of a long-forgotten curse. They scuttle forward with unnatural speed, closing the door firmly behind you, sealing your fate within these haunted walls.
	
	“Welcome...”
	
	The hands seem to whisper in a chilling chorus, echoing off the walls as you gasp in surprise. Your hearts race as the realization hits—you are not alone. The mansion, once merely an old relic, has come alive with a sinister energy, and it knows you are here.
	
	As the last echoes of the door's thud fade, you hear the creaking of floorboards above you, and the unsettling feeling of being watched returns, tenfold. The mansion is an ancient, living thing, and it welcomes you with open, ghostly hands.`
Chinese:

	当你踏入布莱克威尔庄园的门槛时，一阵寒意从脊背上升起。里面的空气厚重而满是灰尘，陈腐的腐朽气味如同裹尸布般环绕着你。火把发出的闪烁光芒在褪色的墙纸上舞动，显现出扭曲而诡异的图案，仿佛在阴影中扭动着。宏伟的前厅空无一人，只有你在冰冷的木地板上走动的回声。
	
	突然，身后的沉重门发出巨响，咕咚一声关上，回荡在大厅里。你转身看到门自行上锁，仿佛拥有了自己的意志，将你锁在这里。一阵不安的感觉涌上心头，就在你准备表达担忧时，注意到昏暗光线中的移动。
	
	从房间的角落，两只巨大的爬行手从阴影中伸出——黑暗、骨瘦、扭曲，仿佛是被遗忘已久的诅咒的残余。它们以不自然的速度爬向前方，坚定地将门关紧，将你的命运封闭在这 haunted 的墙内。
	
	“欢迎……”
	
	这些手似乎在低声耳语，形成一阵令人毛骨悚然的合唱，在墙壁上回响，你惊愕地喘息。随着意识的到来，你的心跳加速——你并不孤单。这个曾经只是古老遗物的庄园，现在已充满了阴险的能量，它知道你在这里。
	
	随着门声最后的回响消逝，你听到楼上地板的吱吱声，令人不安的被注视的感觉又加重了。这个庄园是一个古老的、活着的存在，张开幽灵般的双手欢迎你。
