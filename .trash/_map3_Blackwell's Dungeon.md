### Chamber 1: Entry Hall

- **Grid Size**: 4x3 squares.

- **Description**: A narrow, claustrophobic corridor that leads the party deeper into the underground dungeon. Old, broken torches flicker dimly, casting long shadows.

- **Trap**: A pressure plate trap (2x2 squares) is set 2 squares from the entrance, triggered by stepping on it. Failure to spot it leads to the walls closing in for bludgeoning damage.
  
- **Monologue**:
  `"As you step into the narrow hallway, the stale air presses against you, thick with the scent of mildew and age. The torchlight flickers uneasily, and the ground creaks with unseen tension. Something isn’t right here."`

  `“当你走进狭窄的走廊时，一股陈腐的空气扑面而来，散发着浓重的霉味和陈年的气息。火炬的光芒闪烁不定，地面因看不见的紧张而吱吱作响。这里有些不对劲。”`
### Chamber 2: Hall of Whispers

- **Grid Size**: 4x3 squares.

- **Description**: A long hall where voices seem to echo softly, even though nothing seems to be causing the sound. Ancient murals line the walls, depicting old, forgotten rituals.
  
- **Puzzle**: Knowledge (Arcana or Religion) or Perception check reveals a hidden message in the murals — the eternal flames must be extinguished using the pendant.
  
- **Monologue**:
	`"The voices grow louder, like a forgotten prayer, bouncing from wall to wall. The air grows thicker as you approach a set of intricate murals, glowing faintly. They tell the tale of an ancient family bound by fire... and betrayal."`
	
	`“声音越来越大，就像被遗忘的祈祷，在墙上回荡。当你走近一组复杂的壁画时，空气变得越来越浓重，它们散发着微弱的光芒。它们讲述了一个古老家族被火……和背叛所束缚的故事。”`

### Chamber 3: Flame of Fear Room

- **Grid Size**: 5x5 squares.
  
- **Description**: A large room with a green-flamed brazier in the center. The flame seems to pulse with energy, casting eerie, green light across the stone walls.
  
- **Encounter**: 2 wraiths lurk near the flame, ready to attack anyone who steps close to the brazier.
  
- **Features**: The green-flamed brazier occupies a 2x2 space in the center, with debris and bones scattered across the floor.
  
- **Monologue**:
    `"As you step closer to the brazier, the green flames cast haunting shadows across the chamber. The air chills, and from the darkness, something stirs. Wraiths... they’ve been waiting."`
    
    `“当你走近火盆时，绿色的火焰在房间里投下令人难以忘怀的阴影。空气变得寒冷，黑暗中，有什么东西在骚动。幽灵……它们一直在等待。”`

### Chamber 4: Hall of Shadows

- **Grid Size**: 6x3 squares (long narrow hallway).
  
- **Description**: A shadowy, winding corridor that seems to stretch further than its actual length. Dark shadows cling to the walls, writhing unnaturally.
  
- **Trap**: Shadow tendrils (occupying a 3x3 section of the hallway) lash out at the players, dealing necrotic damage unless they can spot and avoid them. A successful Perception check or Reflex save avoids the lash.
  
- **Monologue**:
	`"The corridor ahead twists like a serpent, the shadows moving with a life of their own. Every step feels heavier, as if the darkness itself is trying to pull you in. And then, you see them—shadowy tendrils writhing along the walls, waiting to strike."`
	
	`“前面的走廊像蛇一样蜿蜒曲折，阴影有自己的生命力。每一步都感觉更沉重，仿佛黑暗本身正试图将你拉进去。然后，你看到了它们——阴暗的卷须沿着墙壁扭动，等待着攻击。”`

### Chamber 5: Flame of Wrath Room

- **Grid Size**: 6x6 squares.
  
- **Description**: A large chamber bathed in red light from a brazier in the center. The temperature in the room is noticeably higher, and the ground is covered in cracked stone and debris.
  
- **Encounter**: 3 skeleton warriors surround the brazier, acting as its guardians.
  
- **Features**: The red-flamed brazier occupies a 2x2 space, with shattered bones and weapons scattered about.
  
- **Monologue**:
    `"The red flame flickers in the center of the chamber, and with every pulse of its light, the skeletal remains on the floor seem to shift. Then, with a loud crack, the bones rise—skeletons, their swords drawn, ready to fight."`
    
    `“红色火焰在房间中央闪烁，随着火焰的每一次闪烁，地板上的骷髅残骸似乎都在移动。然后，随着一声巨响，骨头升了起来——骷髅们拔出了剑，准备战斗。”`

### Chamber 6: Webbed Chamber

- **Grid Size**: 6x6 squares.
  
- **Description**: A smaller chamber filled with thick, hanging webs. The remains of previous explorers lie entangled in the webbing.
  
- **Encounter**: 1 Web Lurker hides among the webbing, ready to ambush the party.
  
- **Features**: A collapsed bookshelf and an alchemical table (occupying 2x2 squares) are near the corner, while the webs cover the rest of the room.
  
- **Monologue**:
    `"Webs stretch across the room like a thick curtain, clinging to every surface. The faint outline of a body hangs in the corner, its eyes staring lifelessly at you from the web’s embrace. And somewhere, something watches you."`
    
    `“蛛网像厚厚的窗帘一样横跨整个房间，紧紧贴住每个表面。角落里挂着一具模糊的尸体轮廓，它的眼睛在蛛网的包围下无神地盯着你。而在某个地方，有什么东西在注视着你。”`

### Chamber 7: Chamber of Despair

- **Grid Size**: 7x7 squares.
- **Description**: The air in this room is unnaturally cold, and a dark purple flame flickers ominously in the center.
- **Encounter**: 3 flaming skulls hover around the flame, their hollow eyes burning with malevolent intent.
- **Features**: A purple-flamed brazier (2x2 squares) sits in the center, with rubble and ancient tombs strewn across the floor.
- **Monologue**:
    `"The cold bites at your skin as you step into the chamber. A purple flame dances in the center, casting long, sinister shadows across the walls. The silence is broken by the crackling of flame, and from the darkness, three skulls emerge, their eyes burning with fire."`
    `“当你走进房间时，寒冷刺痛着你的皮肤。紫色的火焰在中心跳动，在墙壁上投下长长的、险恶的阴影。寂静被火焰的噼啪声打破，从黑暗中，出现了三个骷髅，它们的眼睛燃烧着火焰。”`

### Chamber 8: Flame of Sorrow Room

- **Grid Size**: 8x8 squares.
- **Description**: The room is eerily quiet, save for the low hum of a blue flame. The air feels heavy, as if sorrow itself permeates the room.
- **Encounter**: 1 constructed golem guards the blue flame, a relic of ancient craftsmanship.
- **Features**: The blue-flamed brazier (2x2 squares) rests in the center, with mechanical debris and old armor pieces scattered around.
- **Monologue**:
    `"The blue flame glows softly, casting an almost mournful light over the chamber. The air is heavy, thick with sorrow. A figure stands motionless by the brazier—a golem, ancient and powerful, its eyes flickering with life as it locks onto you."`
    `“蓝色的火焰柔和地闪烁着，将一种几乎悲伤的光芒投射到房间里。空气沉重，充满悲伤。一个人影一动不动地站在火盆旁边——一个古老而强大的傀儡，它的眼睛闪烁着生命，它锁定了你。”`

### Chamber 9: Final Ritual Chamber

- **Grid Size**: 10x8 squares.
- **Description**: The grand ritual chamber. The obelisk stands tall in the center, surrounded by the four eternal flames, one for each color. The chamber is wide, with carvings of demonic symbols etched into the walls.
- **Encounter**: **Lord Hargrave** waits for the players to place the pendant, triggering his resurrection. After the pendant is placed, **Lady Blackwell betrays the party**.
- **Features**:
    - **Obelisk** (2x2 squares) in the center, the focus of the ritual.
    - Braziers for the four eternal flames (2x2 each) in each corner.
- **Monologue**:
     `"As you step into the final chamber, the obelisk looms over you, its surface covered in ancient runes. The flames, each flickering with their respective colors, cast a haunting glow across the walls. And then, you feel it—the presence of something powerful, waiting to be unleashed."`
     
     `“当你踏入最后的房间时，方尖碑耸立在你面前，其表面刻满了古老的符文。每一团火焰都闪烁着各自的颜色，在墙壁上投射出令人难以忘怀的光芒。然后，你感觉到了它的存在——某种强大的力量正在等待被释放。”`
